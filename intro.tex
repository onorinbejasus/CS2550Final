This design document presents the underlying features behind \textit{Pikachu's Revenge}'s \textit{myPTM}: my Pitt Transaction Manager. The goal of this system is to provide transactional limited support for a small database system by developing a concurrency control module, \textit{myPTM}. This control module will provide standard uncontrolled access to files while also providing both serialization and atomic access to the database using \textit{Strict Two-Phase Locking}. Our design aborts transactions due to deadlock by implementing the \textit{Wait-for Graph} detection scheme. The following section outlines the overall design of the system.

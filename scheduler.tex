The scheduler of \textit{myPTM} implements \textit{Strict Two-Phase Locking (S2PL)} as its lock manager. This sub manager works as follows:

\begin{algorithmic}

	\If{T wants to read/write on an object}
	\State Obtains S/X lock.
	\State Holds lock until end of transaction 
	\EndIf
   
\end{algorithmic}  . \\

This locking scheme thus guarantees serializability, a recoverable schedule, avoidance of cascading aborts, and that the precedence graph will be acyclic. $myPTM$ employs the following data structure to handle the locking:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{lockTable}hash of lock entries: OID, Mode, List, List Wait queue
\subitem Number of transactions currently holding a lock
\subitem Type of lock held (shared or exclusive)
\subitem Pointer to queue of lock requests
\end{itemize}

The second submodule that the schedule controls is the deadlock detector. For this detection, \textit{myPTM} employs the \textit{Wait for Graph} deadlock detection scheme, where nodes of the graph are the transactions with edges from $node_i$ to $node_j$ represent a conflict of $node_i$ waiting for $node_j$. This submodule uses the data structure:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{wfgMatrix} - keep track of dependencies 
\subitem TID
\subitem waitForTID
\end{itemize}

to keep track of the dependencies across the transactions. 

The following is how the module will be implemented. The variable \textbf{logFile} handles the scheduler's log: \\
